## Overview

This is the code test for Robert Anderson.

Thanks for seeing me on Wednesday, it was great to meet you.

I have used React for the javascript framework and Bootstrap for the responsive design framework.

SASS was used for the css precompilation.

I used Webpack and Node Package Manager for the build tools.


## Installation

In node package manager console, cd to the root folder and type npm start.

Or you can view the deployed project here:
[github deployment site]


## Tests

I have used Jest for unit testing. These tests can be run from the NodeJS console through the npm test command.
