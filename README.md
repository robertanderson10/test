## Overview

This is the code test for Robert Anderson.

I have used React for the javascript framework and Bootstrap for the responsive design framework.

SASS was used for the css precompilation.

I used Webpack and Node Package Manager for the build tools.

There is still work to complete on this. I have hooked up methods to respond to the commands but need to code the actions to move the turtle.

The click events calculate the correct tile in the this version.


## Installation

In node package manager console, cd to the root folder and type npm start.

Or you can view the deployed project here:
