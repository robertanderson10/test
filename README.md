## Overview

This is the code test for Robert Anderson.

I have used React for the javascript framework and Bootstrap for the responsive design framework.

SASS was used for the css precompilation.

I used Webpack and Node Package Manager for the build tools.


## TODO Work
In this version, I have hooked up the events in and added the click events for the tiles but still need to add the logic for the move and place methods in the javascript.


## Installation

In node package manager console, cd to the root folder and type npm start.

Or you can view the deployed project here:

## Tests

The aim is to have jest hooked up and run from the NodeJS console through the npm test command.
